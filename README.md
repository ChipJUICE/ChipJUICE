# 👋 Hi, I'm Naveen Kumar (ChipJUICE)

🎓 **MS in Computer Engineering** @ **NYU Tandon** — *Graduating May 2026*  
💡 **ASIC Physical Design | RTL → GDSII | SoC Integration | Timing Closure**

I’m a hardware engineer passionate about building **production-grade silicon**, with deep hands-on experience in **full-chip physical design**, **custom RTL systems**, and **advanced SoC integration** using both **industry EDA tools** and **open-source flows**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

### 🔹 ASIC / Physical Design
- RTL → **GDSII** full flow (floorplanning, CTS, routing, signoff)
- **MMMC STA**, timing closure, ECO flows
- **DRC/LVS**, IR drop, congestion, antenna fixes
- **Macro-aware floorplanning** & PDN (rings, straps, SRoute)
- **TSMC 16nm-class PDK**

### 🔹 Tools & EDA
**Cadence:** Innovus, Virtuoso, Tempus, Conformal  
**Synopsys:** Design Compiler, VCS, Verdi  
**Languages:** SystemVerilog, Verilog, Tcl, Python, C/C++
